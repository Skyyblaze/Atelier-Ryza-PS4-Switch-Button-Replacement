# Atelier-Ryza-PS4-Switch-Button-Replacement

# General Info:

In this guide I'll explain how to alter the game to either show Playstation 4 Dualshock 4, or Nintendo Switch Pro Controller icons instead of the default XBOX One icons so let's get going! :)

We'll use the tool SpecialK to inject the new textures.

The texture-mod is based upon the work of Steam User Monterossa from here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1121560/discussions/0/1696095261011549013/

I simply built onto their work and expanded it for all languages and Nintendo Switch icons.

Unlike theirs, my mod doesn't swap the touch-pad icon for the SHARE button icon for the PS4 version. However my guide will also explain how to get the correct touch-pad and SHARE behavior on PC with a Dualshock 4.


# Necessary Downloads:

SpecialK: https://special-k.info/


# Installation:

I'll try to make the instructions as simple as possible and step by step.

1: Install SpecialK

2: Run SpecialK

3: In SpecialK go to Library and launch Ryza

4: SpecialK should initialize as the game starts, press CTRL + SHIFT + Backspace to open the SpecialK overlay

5: Click on File --> Install Wrapper DLL

6: Click on File --> Initialize Texture Mods

7: Click on File --> Browse Texture Assets --> Injectable Textures

8: A new folder will open, copy only either the Switch or PS4 textures into it, just the .dds files

9: After that go back to Ryza, exit the game and SpecialK

10: Run the game normally through Steam and things should work

11: Have fun! :D


# How to make the Dualshock 4 Touchpad work like on a PS4 (Also works with a Dualsense):

If you are playing with a PS4 controller you might now notice that the game shows the PS4 touchpad icon in a few cases but only half of the touchpad actually works as intended and the SHARE button has the same function as half of the touchpad.

To fix this and get the same experience as on an actual PS4 you can load my customized controller configuration. It will make the whole touchpad work as intended and as a bonus let you take screenshots with the SHARE button.

To use my configuration, first connect your PS4 controller to your PC either wireless or wired and then enter the following link in your web-browser:

steam://controllerconfig/1121560/1903246374

A new Steam Input window should pop-up letting you preview the configuration. Press Square to apply and save it. When you launch the game now the new config should be loaded.

# Warning:

This won't work if you use DS4Windows or any other Dualshock 4 tool. It's intended for users that use a Dualshock 4 via Steam's native Steam Input implementation.
